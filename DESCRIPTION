Title: Fetch Sections of XML Scholarly Articles
Description: Get chunks of XML scholarly articles without
    having to know how to work with XML. Custom mappers
    for each publisher and for each article section pull
    out the information you want. Works with outputs from
    package 'fulltext', 'xml2' package documents, and file
    paths to XML documents.
